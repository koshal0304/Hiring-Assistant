    "Okay, here are 5 comprehensive technical assessment questions, tailored for a senior engineer claiming proficiency in Python, Django, React, PostgreSQL, and Docker, designed to probe their understanding deeply:",
    "**Question 1:  Django & PostgreSQL - Optimizing a Complex Query**",
    "\"Imagine you're building an e-commerce platform with Django and PostgreSQL. You have three models: `Product`, `Category`, and `Order`. Each `Product` belongs to a `Category`, and each `Order` can contain multiple `Product` instances.  You need to generate a report showing the top 5 most frequently purchased categories in the last month, including the total revenue generated by each of those categories.",
    "1.  Write the Django ORM query (or a reasonable approximation if you're concerned about query complexity) to retrieve this data efficiently.  Consider the scalability of the solution as the number of orders and products grows significantly.",
    "2.  Explain potential performance bottlenecks in your query and describe two concrete optimizations you could implement, one at the database level (PostgreSQL-specific) and one within the Django ORM itself (e.g., using select_related, prefetch_related, or annotations). Provide specific examples of how these optimizations would be implemented."
