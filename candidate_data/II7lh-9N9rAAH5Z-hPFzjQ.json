    "1.  **Scenario:** You're building a Django API endpoint to handle user profile updates. The endpoint receives a JSON payload containing potentially partial updates to fields like `first_name`, `last_name`, `email`, and `profile_picture`. Describe your approach to implementing this endpoint, addressing the following:",
    "*   How would you validate the incoming data, ensuring data integrity and security? Discuss the trade-offs between different validation methods (e.g., Django's forms vs. serializers, custom validation).",
    "*   How would you handle potential concurrency issues if multiple users try to update the same profile simultaneously?",
    "*   How would you efficiently update the user profile model with only the fields that were actually provided in the payload?  Discuss methods to avoid unnecessary database writes."
