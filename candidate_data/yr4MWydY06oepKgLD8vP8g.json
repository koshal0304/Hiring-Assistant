    "Here are 5 technical questions tailored for a candidate with expertise in Python, Django, React, PostgreSQL, and Docker, focusing on practical understanding and problem-solving:",
    "1.  **You have a Django application serving a large number of requests.  You notice that database queries are becoming a bottleneck. Describe three distinct strategies you could implement to improve database performance. For each strategy, explain the trade-offs (pros and cons) and under what circumstances you would choose that specific approach over the others. Assume that the queries themselves are well-optimized.**",
    "*   *This question aims to assess the candidate's understanding of Django ORM optimization, caching strategies, database indexing, connection pooling, and potential for read replicas/sharding. The \"trade-offs\" aspect encourages nuanced thinking.*",
    "2.  **You're building a feature in your React application that involves displaying a dynamically updating list of data fetched from a Django REST API. The list needs to be filterable and sortable client-side, and the data is frequently changing on the server. Describe your approach to managing the state of this list (both in terms of data and UI state like sorting/filtering) and efficiently updating the UI when new data arrives. How would you handle pagination? Consider performance and user experience.**",
    "*   *This tests the candidate's understanding of React state management (Redux, Context API, useState/useReducer), API integration with React, performance optimization with memoization or virtualization, and handling asynchronous updates. Pagination strategy demonstrates understanding of common UI patterns.*"
